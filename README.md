# DEPRECATION NOTICE

Librato now [provides native
support](http://support.metrics.librato.com/knowledgebase/articles/749103-server-monitoring-with-librato-collectd)
for Collectd via the [Write HTTP plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Write_HTTP)
included in most distributions. This has many advantages over the legacy
Python plugin including fewer dependencies (e.g. Python!) and much
simpler configuration. It is now the recommended approach for system
monitoring in Librato via Collectd. This plugin, while still functional,
should be considered deprecated and not used in new deployments.

# Introduction

collectd-librato is a [collectd](http://www.collectd.org/) plugin that
publishes collectd values to [Librato
Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com) using the Librato Metrics
[API](http://dev.librato.com). Librato Metrics is a hosted,
time-series data service.

Collectd-librato was largely influenced by
[collectd-carbon](https://github.com/indygreg/collectd-carbon).

# Requirements

* Collectd versions 4.9.5, 4.10.3, and 5.0.0 (or later). Earlier
  versions of 4.9.x and 4.10.x may require a patch to fix the Python
  plugin in collectd (See below).
* Python 2.6 or later.
* An active Librato Metrics account (sign up
  [here](https://metrics.librato.com/sign_up)).

# Installation

## Using Chef

If you are using Chef, there is now a [Chef
cookbook](https://github.com/librato/collectd-librato-cookbook)
available that will install and configure the collectd Librato plugin.

## Using Ansible

If you are using Ansible, Bruce Burgess has [added](https://github.com/iceburg-net/ansible-pcd/commit/c16eac4a8be47b96a9f3dce06c157e7baf70c24e) Librato collectd integration to their [ansible-pcd](https://github.com/iceburg-net/ansible-pcd) framework.

## RHEL / CentOS RPMs

[Eric-Olivier Lamey](https://github.com/eolamey) provides RPM packages
for the collectd-librato plugin on RHEL/CentOS 5.x and 6.x
distributions using his [pakk repo](https://github.com/eolamey/pakk).

To install collectd-librato from the pakk repo:

1. Make sure you have the EPEL repository [configured](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).
1. Enable the [pakk
repository](http://pakk.96b.it/repositories/). As root do: `wget -O  /etc/yum.repos.d/pakk.repo http://pakk.96b.it/pakk.repo`
1. Install the plugin. As root do: `yum install collectd-librato`
1. Configure the `/etc/collectd.d/librato.conf` file as described below.

If you have a `/etc/collectd5.conf` file it should probably contain something like the following:
```
BaseDir     "/var/lib/collectd5"
PIDFile     "/var/run/collectd5.pid"
TypesDB     "/usr/share/collectd5/types.db"
LoadPlugin syslog
LoadPlugin cpu
LoadPlugin interface
LoadPlugin load
LoadPlugin memory
<LoadPlugin "python">
  Globals true
</LoadPlugin>
<Plugin "python">
  ModulePath "/usr/lib64/collectd/python"
  Import "collectd-librato"
  <Module "collectd-librato">
    Email    "LIBRATO_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
    APIToken "LIBRATO_API_TOKEN"
  </Module>
</Plugin>

```

## Troubleshooting
Check the logs: `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog`, etc.

`Starting collectd5: Could not find plugin rrdtool.`

The collectd daemon has been configured to load the collectd plugin named "rrdtool" but it can't find it.
If you are only sending data to Librato this can be safely ignored and
the `LoadPlugin rrdtool` statement in the collectd configuration can be removed.


```
Unhandled python exception in init callback: Exception: Collectd-Librato.py: ERROR: Unable to open TypesDB file: /usr/share/collectd/types.db.
plugin_dispatch_values: No write callback has been registered. Please load at least one output plugin, if you want the collected data to be stored.
Filter subsystem: Built-in target `write': Dispatching value to all write plugins failed with status 2 (ENOENT). Most likely this means you didn't load any write plugins.
```

The collectd daemon plugin for librato could not find a file that it needs.
This file is probably present but in a different location. Try the following:

```
cd /usr/share
ln -s collectd5 collectd
```


## From Source

Installation from source is provided by the Makefile included in the
project.

Simply clone this repository and run make install as root:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/librato/collectd-librato.git
$ cd collectd-librato
$ sudo make install
Installed collected-librato plugin, add this
to your collectd configuration to load this plugin:

    <LoadPlugin "python">
        Globals true
    </LoadPlugin>

    <Plugin "python">
        # collectd-librato.py is at /opt/collectd-librato-0.0.10/lib/collectd-librato.py
        ModulePath "/opt/collectd-librato-0.0.10/lib"

        Import "collectd-librato"

        <Module "collectd-librato">
            Email    "joe@example.com"
            APIToken "1985481910fe29ab201302011054857292"
        </Module>
    </Plugin>
```

The output above includes a sample configuration file for the
plugin. Simply add this to `/etc/collectd.conf` or drop in the
configuration directory as `/etc/collectd.d/librato.conf` and restart
collectd. See the next section for an explanation of the plugin's
configuration variables.



# Configuration

The plugin requires some configuration. This is done by passing
parameters via the <Module> config section in your Collectd config.

To control the frequency (resolution) of metrics sent by collectd to
Librato, you must update the collectd option
[`Interval`](http://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Interval) specified
in the global *collectd.conf* file to the desired resolution in seconds.

The following parameters are required:

* `Email` - The email address associated with your Librato Metrics
  account.

* `APIToken` - The API token for you Librato Metrics account. This value
  can be found your [account page](https://metrics.librato.com/account).

The following parameters are optional:

* `TypesDB` - file(s) defining your Collectd types. This should be the
  sames as your TypesDB global config parameters, but multiple values should
  be separated by commas instead of spaces:
  ```TypesDB "/usr/share/collectd/types.db,/my/custom/collectd_type.db"```
  This will default to the file `/usr/share/collectd/types.db`. **NOTE**: 
  This plugin will not work if it can't find the types.db file.

* `LowercaseMetricNames` - If preset, all metric names will be converted
  to lower-case (default no lower-casing).

* `MetricPrefix` - If present, all metric names will contain this string
  prefix. Do not include a trailing period or separation character
  (see `MetricSeparator`). Set to the empty string to disable any
  prefix. Defaults to "collectd".

* `MetricSeparator` - String to separate the components of a metric name
  when combining the plugin name, type, and instance name. Defaults to
  a period (".").

* `IncludeSingleValueNames` - Normally, any metric type listed in
  `types.db` that only has a single value will not have the name of
  the value suffixed onto the metric name. For most single value
  metrics the name is simply a placeholder like "value" or "count", so
  adding it to the metric name does not add any particular value. If
  `IncludeSingleValueNames` is set however, these value names will be
  suffixed onto the metric name regardless.

* `Source` - By default the source name is taken from the configured
  collectd hostname. If you want to override the source name that is
  used with Librato Metrics you can set the `Source` variable to a
  different source name.

* `IncludeRegex` - This option can be used to control the metrics that
  are sent to Librato Metrics. It should be set to a comma-separated
  list of regular expression patterns to match metric names
  against. If a metric name does not match one of the regex's in this
  variable, it will not be sent to Librato Metrics. By default, all
  metrics in collectd are sent to Librato Metrics. For example, the
  following restricts the set of metrics to CPU and select df metrics:

  `IncludeRegex "collectd.cpu.*,collectd.df.df.dev.free,collectd.df.df.root.free"`

* `FloorTimeSecs` - Set the time interval (in seconds) to floor all
  measurement times to. This will ensure that the real-time samples on
  graphs will align on the time interval boundary across multiple
  collectd hosts. By default, measurement times are not floored and use
  the exact timestamp emitted from collectd. This value should be set
  to the same `Interval` defined in the main *collectd.conf*.

## Example

The following is an example Collectd configuration for this plugin:

    <LoadPlugin "python">
        Globals true
    </LoadPlugin>

    <Plugin "python">
        # collectd-librato.py is at /opt/collectd-librato-0.0.10/lib/collectd-librato.py
        ModulePath "/opt/collectd-librato-0.0.10/lib"

        Import "collectd-librato"

        <Module "collectd-librato">
            Email    "joe@example.com"
            APIToken "1985481910fe29ab201302011054857292"
        </Module>
    </Plugin>

## Supported Metrics

Collectd-Librato currently supports the following collectd metric
types:

* GAUGE - Reported as a Librato Metric
  [gauge](http://dev.librato.com/v1/gauges).
* COUNTER - Reported as a Librato Metric
  [counter](http://dev.librato.com/v1/counters).
* DERIVE - Reported as a Librato Metric
  [counter](http://dev.librato.com/v1/counters).

Other metric types are currently ignored. This list will be expanded
in the future.

# Simpler CPU metrics

Collectd's CPU plugin will, by default, break out each CPU's
individual user, system, wait, etc. time as an individual metric. In
total there are eight different CPU times, so for a box with 24 cores
there will be 24 * 8 => 192 metrics published. In most cases you don't
actually need the granularity that the breakout provides, you simply
want to know user time vs. idle time, etc.

With collectd release 5.2 there is now an
[aggregation](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Aggregation)
plugin that can aggregate across collectd metrics before they are sent
on to the write plugins (and on to Librato). To use this plugin we
follow the [example
configuration](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Aggregation/Config)
for aggregating CPU metrics across a host. Add the following to your
collectd.conf:

```
LoadPlugin aggregation

<Plugin "aggregation">
  <Aggregation>
    Plugin "cpu"
    Type "cpu"

    GroupBy "Host"
    GroupBy "TypeInstance"

    CalculateSum true
    CalculateAverage true
  </Aggregation>
</Plugin>
```

This will compute the sum and average of each CPU timing metric across
all CPUs. The metrics will be sent as:
*collectd.aggregation.cpu-sum.cpu.idle*,
*collectd.aggregation.cpu-sum.cpu.wait*, etc.

Once you have that working, the next step is to drop the breakout CPU
metrics from posting to your account. You can use the collectd
[chains](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Chains) feature to filter
out the CPU metrics by adding the following to your collectd.conf:

```
LoadPlugin match_regex

<Chain "PostCache">
  <Rule "ignore_cpu" > # Send "cpu" values to the aggregation plugin.
    <Match "regex">
      Plugin "^cpu$"
    </Match>
    <Target "write">
      Plugin "aggregation"
    </Target>
    Target stop
  </Rule>
  Target "write"

</Chain>
```

Once you have this setup, create an instrument that stacks the eight
aggregated CPU timing metrics to get a break out of CPU performance:

# Operational Notes

This plugin uses a best-effort attempt to deliver metrics to Librato
Metrics. If a flush fails to POST metrics to Librato Metrics the flush
will not currently be retried, but instead dropped. In most cases this
should not happen, but if it does the plugin will continue to flush
metrics after the failure. So in the worst case there may appear a
short gap in your metric graphs.

The plugin needs to parse Collectd type files. If there was an error
parsing a specific type (look for log messages at Collectd startup
time), the plugin will fail to write values for this type. It will
simply skip over them and move on to the next value. It will write a log
message every time this happens so you can correct the problem.

The plugin needs to perform redundant parsing of the type files because
the Collectd Python API does not provide an interface to the types
information (unlike the Perl and Java plugin APIs). Hopefully this will
be addressed in a future version of Collectd.

# Data Mangling

Collectd data is collected/written in discrete tuples having the
following:

    (host, plugin, plugin_instance, type, type_instance, time, interval, metadata, values)

_values_ is itself a list of { counter, gauge, derive, absolute }
(numeric) values. To further complicate things, each distinct _type_ has
its own definition corresponding to what's in the _values_ field.

Librato Metrics, by contrast, deals with tuples of:

    (source, metric_name, value, measurement_time)

So we effectively have to mangle the collectd tuple down to the fields
above.

The `source` is simply set to the *host* field of the collectd
tuple. The plugin mangles the remaining fields of the collectd tuple
to the following Librato Metrics `metric_name`:

    [metric_prefix.]plugin[.plugin_instance].type[.type_instance].data_source

Where *data_source* is the name of the data source (i.e. ds_name) in
the type being written. In the case that the plugin data source only
has a single value, the *data_source* is not included in the name
(unless `IncludeSingleValueNames` is set).

For example, the Collectd distribution has a built-in _df_ type:

    df used:GAUGE:0:1125899906842623, free:GAUGE:0:1125899906842623

The *data_source* values for this type would be *used* and *free*
yielding the metric names (along the lines of)
*collectd.df.df.root.used* and *collectd.df.df.root.free* for the
*root* file-system.

# Troubleshooting

## Collectd Python Write Callback Bug

Collectd versions through 4.10.2 and 4.9.4 have a bug in the Python
plugin where Python would receive bad values for certain data
sets. The bug would typically manifest as data values appearing to be
0. The *collectd-carbon* author identified the bug and sent a fix to
the Collectd development team.

Collectd versions 4.9.5, 4.10.3, and 5.0.0 are the first official
versions with a fix for this bug. If you are not running one of these
versions or have not applied the fix (which can be seen at
<https://github.com/indygreg/collectd/commit/31bc4bc67f9ae12fb593e18e0d3649e5d4fa13f2>),
you will likely dispatch wrong values to Librato Metrics.

## Collectd on Redhat ImportError

Using the plugin with collectd on Redhat-based distributions (RHEL,
CentOS, Fedora) may produce the following error:

This may also occur on other operating systems and collectd
versions. It is caused by a libtool/libltdl quirk described in
[this mailing list
thread](http://mailman.verplant.org/pipermail/collectd/2008-March/001616.html).
